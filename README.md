# Coding Events 
This web application is a tool for creating and maintaining a list of tech events in the local area. 

I worked on this application as part of my LauncCode web development bootcamp. It provided a great training ground for learning about the interaction of Java, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf.

## Purpose of the application
The Coding Events web application is designed to store and display a list of events linked to a persistent database (in my case MySQL).  
A user can view events, add new ones, and create interest tags (#Java, etc.) that can be linked to various events.

From a code standpoint, the application highlights numerous features inherent in Java controller classes, persistent entity classes, and Thymeleaf view templates.  
It utilizes model binding to handle form input.

## Current Features
Currently, a user can:  
- View a list of existing events :hand:
- View the details of an individual event :point_left:
- Add a new event :point_up:
- Remove an existing event :point_down:
- View tags :cool:
- Create new tags :punch:
- Link tags to events :muscle:

## Future Improvements
As I continue to work on this application, I hope at some point to include the following features:
- Edit the details of an existing event
- Allow users to create a saved profile that stores:
  1. saved tags (to show what they're interested in)
  2. saved specific events
  3. a personalized calendar of upcoming saved events

## Acknowledgements :raised_hands:
I want to thank LaunchCode for providing me with the opportunity to be a part of their web development bootcamp and for teaching us all the awesomeness of Java, Javascript, SQL, and everything else.  
Never stop learning! Never stop coding!
